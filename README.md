Smart Education — A web-based analytics dashboard that visualizes student performance through KPIs, subject averages, exam trends, leaderboards, study heatmaps, and mastery indicators, offering interactive insights for teachers and students using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Step 1: Define sections

Decide which parts the dashboard will have:

Key performance indicators (KPIs) – average score, pass rate.

Subject-wise performance.

Exam trends.

Student leaderboard.

Study sessions heatmap.

Mastery/progress donut.

Step 2: Layout design

Arrange sections visually:

Use grid or flexbox.

KPIs on top, charts in the middle, leaderboard and heatmap below.

Make it responsive for different screen sizes.

Step 3: Prepare sample data

List of students, subjects, exams.

Scores per student per subject per exam.

Attendance percentage.

Heatmap showing study sessions across days/hours.

Step 4: Compute metrics

Average score.

Pass rate (percentage of students passing).

Subject averages.

Exam trends.

Top students.

Mastery percentage for each student.

Step 5: Design KPI cards

Each card displays a metric (average score, pass rate).

Make it visually distinct using colors, icons, and bold numbers.

Step 6: Visualize subject averages

Use bar charts to show average score per subject.

Compare subjects side by side to see strengths and weaknesses.

Step 7: Visualize exam trends

Use line charts to show score progression across exams.

Helps detect improvement or decline over time.

Step 8: Show leaderboard

Rank students based on a combination of scores and attendance.

Highlight top performers.

Can include avatars, badges, or colors for gamification.

Step 9: Create heatmap

Display study session frequency per day and hour.

Darker colors = more study sessions.

Helps visualize student activity patterns.

Step 10: Mastery/progress donut

Show percentage of subjects each student has mastered.

Easy visual indicator of overall performance.

Can use color coding to indicate progress levels.
